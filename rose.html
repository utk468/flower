    rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),[4] in the family Rosaceae
    (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),[4] or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of
    cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems
    that are often armed with sharp prickles.[5] Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy,
    in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native
    to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa.[5] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their
    beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in
    size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height.[5] Different species
    hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

    Etymology
    The name rose comes from Latin rosa, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον rhódon (Aeolic βρόδον
    wródon), itself borrowed from Old Persian wrd- (wurdi), related to Avestan varəδa, Sogdian ward, Parthian wâr.[6][7]

    Botany

    Rose thorns are actually prickles – outgrowths of the epidermis

    The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species they are 5 to 15 centimetres (2.0 to 5.9 in) long,
    pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (−13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a
    few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast
    Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.

    The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, which usually
    have only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species
    yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, four).
    These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the
    rounded petals. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.[8] Roses are insect-pollinated in
    nature.

    The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called "thorns", are technically prickles, outgrowths of the
    epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are
    typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some
    species such as Rosa rugosa and Rosa pimpinellifolia have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation
    to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and
    protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles,
    roses are frequen
